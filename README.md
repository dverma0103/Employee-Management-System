# Employee Management System (OOPS + JSON | Python)

A menu-driven **Employee Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** principles in Python with **JSON-based file storage**.  
This application allows users to perform CRUD operations on employee records while ensuring data persistence.
=======
# Employee Management System (Python CLI)

A menu-driven Python command-line application to manage employee records.  
The system allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with persistent data storage using a JSON file.

This project is built to strengthen core Python fundamentals and demonstrate clean, modular coding practices.

## ⚙️ How the Application Works
1. On startup, employee data is loaded from `employees.json`
2. User selects an operation from the menu
3. The selected CRUD operation is executed
4. Changes are saved back to the JSON file
5. Data persists even after program exit
=======
## ⚙️ Application Flow
1. The program loads existing employee data from `employees.json` at startup
2. The user selects an option from the menu
3. The selected operation is performed on the employee data
4. Any changes are saved back to the JSON file
5. Data remains available even after the program exits
